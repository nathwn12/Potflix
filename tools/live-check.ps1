.SYNOPSIS
Live end-to-end check of the owner-visible behaviour "PotPlayer closed -> the Discord card clears".

.DESCRIPTION
Runs the real app (dist\potflix.exe) and the real player (PotPlayerMini64) once, against a
real media file, and checks the whole clear path on the real machine:

  1. preconditions (built app, media file, Windows, Discord reachable, no PotPlayer
     running, no Potflix instance already holding the single-instance lock);
  2. the app's freshness line after launch - "instance lock acquired 127.0.0.1:17843"
     past the log offset recorded before launch, a line that can only come from this run;
  3. the card is accepted - a "push details=[" line for the played file followed by
     "push ack nonce=" (Discord accepted the card);
  4. PotPlayer is closed gently (taskkill /IM without /F = a WM_CLOSE request, never a
     kill) and the process is confirmed gone, then a "cleared (" line must be followed
     by "push ack nonce=" with NO "push ack timeout nonce=" in between - an unacked
     clear is the stuck-card bug.

PASS = card acked AND player closed AND clear acked with no ack timeout in between.
The script never starts, stops or restarts Discord, never force-kills PotPlayer, and
never kills a pre-existing Potflix instance; it always stops the app it started.
Exit codes: 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL, 2 = precondition/environment (nothing was changed).

.PARAMETER File
Media file handed to PotPlayer. REQUIRED: pass the media file to play with -File.

.PARAMETER Exe
potflix.exe to launch. Default: ..\dist\potflix.exe relative to this script.

.PARAMETER PotPlayer
PotPlayerMini64.exe to launch. Default: C:\Program Files\DAUM\PotPlayer\PotPlayerMini64.exe.

.PARAMETER CardTimeoutSeconds
Seconds to wait for the card push AND its ack. Default 90.

.PARAMETER ClearTimeoutSeconds
Seconds to wait for the clear and its ack after PotPlayer closes. Default 60.

.PARAMETER KeepLog
Keep the potflix-debug.log lines this run appended (use for post-mortem). Default:
after the app is stopped, this run's appended lines are trimmed back off byte-exactly
(pre-run length + prefix hash must match), so repeated runs stay attributable and the
log does not grow.

.EXAMPLE
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\live-check.ps1 -File <media-file>

.EXAMPLE
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\live-check.ps1 -File <media-file> -CardTimeoutSeconds 30 -KeepLog

.NOTES
Runs on Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell 7+. No external modules. The app writes
potflix-debug.log beside its exe; this script locates every run-produced line by the
line count it records before launch.
