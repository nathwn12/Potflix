//! `window` -- mirrors the Go root files `go\window.go` + `go\settings_sections.go`.
//!
//! The tray-resident settings window: folders list, Scan / Refresh, the live
//! `indexed N of M files | metadata K of J` line with its `- catching up` state,
//! library export/import, `Clear metadata` / `Clear index`, `Report`, startup,
//! scan-speed segments. The scan progress is phase-aware: the bar is driven by
//! `Resolved` of `KeysTotal` so it cannot read full while metadata remains.
//!
//! # Owner-drawn, no child controls (`go\window.go:37-70`)
//!
//! There are no child controls: every rect-table id below is a key into a
//! hit-test table, the whole client area is owner-drawn, and there is no
//! `WM_CTLCOLOR*`/`WM_DRAWITEM` anywhere. Hit-testing and actions run through
//! ONE dispatch (`release_at` / `activate_focused` -> `do_button_action` /
//! `do_settings_action` / `do_card_action`), and the disabled state is enforced
//! AT INPUT via [`scan_blocked_reason`] - porting only the dim paint would lose
//! the guard.
//!
//! # Integer geometry (`go\window.go:3466-3484`)
//!
//! Every value is integer-scaled `(v*dpi+48)/96` from the 460x680 logical
//! design, and font heights are negative. An `f32`/`f64` scale would change
//! hit-tests versus paint, so the port keeps `i32` everywhere.
//!
//! # One OS thread
//!
//! The tray wndproc + main wndproc + `GetMessageW` loop must share one OS
//! thread; workers (poll, scan, report) may never touch the UI - their payloads
//! ride mutex-guarded snapshots and only ever repaint via `InvalidateRect` plus
//! an async `PostMessageW`. The UI state lives in [`UiState`], which the
//! tests construct directly (isolated) and production wraps in a process
//! global.

// The Win32 surface is inherently pointer-taking: every entry point accepts an
// `HWND`/`HDC` and hands it to `windows-sys`. The handles are opaque and the
// module never dereferences them itself, so the lint is silenced module-wide.

// # Scope -> key rules (the store's own derivations; spelled out here once)
//
//   * `Scope::Movie`  -> `movie_key(path)`    (`overrides::movie_key`): the
//     media file's FULL path. A movie offers NO scope radios -- there is only
//     one target -- and the dialog pins it directly.
//   * `Scope::Season` -> `season_key_for(path)`: the folder that directly
//     holds the episode (the `Season N` / `SNN` folder itself, otherwise the
//     release-style folder that IS that season).
//   * `Scope::Series` -> `series_key_for(path)`: the show folder, one level
//     above a `Season N` folder when there is one.
//
// When the two derived keys are EQUAL the folder is both the season and the
// show (a release-style folder like `Atri S01 1080p BDRip`, or an
// absolute-numbered show folder with the episodes inside it): the dialog then
// offers ONE radio for that folder instead of two identical targets, and says
// so in its note. The choice is `Scope::Series` because the label describes the
// folder as the show; the keys are identical either way.
