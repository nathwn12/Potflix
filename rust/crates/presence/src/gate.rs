//! `presence::gate` -- mirrors `go\internal\presence\gate.go`.
//!
//! The send gate: what has to be true before a presence push is allowed out.
//!
//! The app is already event-driven: the tracker emits only when the card changes
//! or a real seek moves the position. The gate sits between the tracker and the
//! wire and decides whether the current card actually goes out. It exists because
//! the tracker's per-poll seek delta can be swallowed (held by the debounce, then
//! never re-fired), which left the card frozen on a stale anchor. The gate adds
//! the two self-healing paths: a divergence re-anchor (live position vs the last
//! anchor Discord was told) and a coarse heartbeat. It also records EVERY
//! decision, so a suppressed poll is visible instead of silent.
//!
//! This is NOT about Discord rate limiting alone: the tracker emits 0/min while
//! steady (change/seek events only), the 30 s heartbeat adds 2/min, and a scrub
//! is ~9/min - all far below Discord's update limit in the steady case. The
//! heartbeat is self-healing for residual divergence, nothing more.
//!
//! The Discord SDK limit still needs a guard for bursts: at most
//! [`RATE_MAX_SENDS`] payload sends per [`RATE_WINDOW_MS`] (5 per 20 s). The
//! gate enforces it as a sliding window over the monotonic interval clock. A
//! changed card sends immediately when the window permits; when the window is
//! full the newest card is coalesced (held) and flushed on the first poll
//! after the window opens. An identical payload is never sent from the hold:
//! a revert to the last-sent card drops the hold. The poll interval itself is
//! never shortened to flush faster.
