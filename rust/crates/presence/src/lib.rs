//! `presence` -- mirrors the Go package `go\internal\presence`.
//!
//! The presence state machine and the activity payload builder.
//!
//! This file is the module body for `go\internal\presence\presence.go`: the
//! transition matrix ([`Tracker`]), the trailing-edge RUN debounce, the card line
//! grammar ([`build_activity`]) and the metadata-resolved card
//! ([`build_activity_resolved`]). [`gate`] is `gate.go` (the send gate) and
//! [`cardspec`] is `cardspec.go` (the Card view's spec model).
//!
//! Ported from me.potflix.rpc.Main (PresenceTracker.poll :265-309,
//! withStateTime :313-317, pushActivity :139-191, fmt :501-508), with one
//! deliberate deviation from the fleet decisions (see [`Tracker`] and the
//! README): repeated RUN pushes within ~1 s are debounced unless the title
//! changed. The debounce is trailing-edge: the suppressed anchor is HELD and
//! emitted when the window expires, so a seek is never dropped forever.
//!
//! Not carried from `presence.go`: the unexported `filterButtons` (:646-652) is
//! never called in the Go original (the builders never populate buttons), so in
//! Rust it would be dead code under `-D warnings`. The pristine-card decision it
//! documents is stated where the call site used to be.
