//! `store` -- mirrors the Go package `go\internal\store`.
//!
//! A crash-safe single-file key/value store for the Potflix library index and
//! the metadata cache. It replaces two shapes that both paid full cost for a
//! small change: a 565,380-byte JSON index rewritten in full on every dirty
//! checkpoint, and 1,118 loose one-JSON-per-key cache files. Here ~25,000
//! records of ~150 bytes live in one append-only frame log behind a 24-byte
//! header: [`open`] reads the file sequentially and rebuilds the map in tens of
//! milliseconds, a checkpoint appends only the keys that changed, and the delta
//! folds back into a snapshot once it grows past [`Options::compact_threshold`].
//!
//! # File format (version 1, locked)
//!
//! ```text
//! header, 24 bytes:
//!   bytes  0..8   magic "PFLXST01"
//!   u32    8..12  formatVersion = 1
//!   u32   12..16  flags (0)
//!   u32   16..20  crc32-IEEE over bytes 0..16
//!   u32   20..24  reserved (0)
//!
//! frames, appended after the header, one per mutation:
//!   u8    tag (1 = put, 2 = delete/tombstone)
//!   u32   payloadLen
//!   u32   crc32-IEEE(payload)
//!   payload
//!
//!   tag 1 payload: uvarint keyLen, key, uvarint valueLen, value
//!   tag 2 payload: uvarint keyLen, key
//! ```
//!
//! Every integer is little-endian; lengths are LEB128 unsigned varints. The CRC
//! is hand-rolled and table-driven ([`crc32`], no crate: the workspace
//! dependency policy). Bytes are bytes: keys and values are `&[u8]`, not
//! `&str`, because the Go original stores and returns arbitrary byte strings
//! (`TestRoundTrip` round-trips a key with `\xff\xfe` in it) and also the empty
//! key. The format is proved against files WRITTEN BY THE GO IMPLEMENTATION --
//! `tests/fixtures/go-*.pflx`, reproduced byte for byte in this crate's tests.
//!
//! # Crash safety
//!
//! A frame is accepted only when its tag is known, its payloadLen fits in the
//! bytes left in the file, its CRC matches, and its payload decodes exactly. The
//! first frame that fails any of those checks ends replay: every earlier record
//! is kept, the invalid tail is discarded, and the file is truncated back to the
//! last valid frame boundary. A torn tail is the normal outcome of an abrupt
//! process kill and is never reported as an error. A file whose header is wrong
//! -- bad magic, unexpected version, or a header CRC mismatch -- IS an error: it
//! is not this store's file. A file shorter than the header (a header write that
//! never finished) is started over, because the store owns the file.
//!
//! # Compaction
//!
//! [`Db::compact`] writes a fresh file (header plus one put frame per live key,
//! in SORTED key order, so the snapshot of a given state is byte-identical
//! whatever order the mutations arrived in) to a temp file in the same
//! directory, syncs it, and renames it over the original; the temp file is
//! removed on failure. The delta accounting resets on every successful open
//! repair and compaction.
//!
//! # Concurrency and process model
//!
//! One mutex guards the in-memory map and the append file, so [`Db::get`],
//! [`Db::put`], [`Db::delete`], [`Db::len`], [`Db::for_each`], [`Db::commit`],
//! [`Db::compact`] and [`Db::stats`] are safe from concurrent threads. Unlike
//! the Go original, [`Db::for_each`] takes `&self`, but it does hold that mutex
//! for the whole iteration, so **the callback must not call back into the same
//! `Db`: `std::sync::Mutex` is not re-entrant and the call will deadlock**. Go
//! returns a slice aliasing stored memory from `Get`; here it is an
//! `Arc<[u8]>`: a refcount bump, not a copy, and still read-only by type.
//!
//! The file is held open read-write for the `Db`'s lifetime and the store
//! assumes a single writing process -- the app holds a single-instance lock on
//! `127.0.0.1:17843` -- so opening the same file from a second process is
//! unsupported.
//!
//! # Removal while open
//!
//! The file is opened with a share mode that lets another party delete it while
//! this process still holds it (`FILE_SHARE_DELETE` on Windows, [`sys`]), so
//! removing the store file -- or the directory holding it -- never fails because
//! this `Db` is open. The removal is reported rather than papered over: reads
//! ([`Db::get`], [`Db::len`], [`Db::for_each`]) keep serving the in-memory
//! records, because they claim no durability, and the next durability claim --
//! [`Db::commit`], a mutation under `Options::sync_on_commit`, or [`Db::close`]
//! -- returns [`Error::Removed`] once the file is no longer at the store's path.
//! Bytes appended before that report went into the orphaned file and are not
//! visible at the path; the error is the only signal, and the in-memory records
//! stay authoritative. From then on every mutation and `commit` keeps reporting
//! it, like any other append failure, until [`Db::compact`] writes a fresh
//! snapshot at the path (recreating the file, when its directory still exists)
//! and clears the failure.
//!
//! # Rust-specific notes
//!
//! * Keys and values are byte strings; every key parameter takes
//!   `impl AsRef<[u8]>`, so `db.get("series|breaking bad|2008|1")` and
//!   `db.get(b"k1")` both compile.
//! * `Drop` flushes and releases like [`Db::close`], ignoring the result: there
//!   is no caller left to report to. The Go original leaves a forgotten
//!   `defer db.Close()` to the GC instead, losing the buffered tail.
