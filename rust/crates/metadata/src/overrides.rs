//! `metadata::overrides` -- the manual "fix the match" latch.
//!
//! NEW SURFACE: `go\` has no override store, so nothing here is diffed against
//! a ported file; the contract is stated plainly instead. It lives in this
//! crate because it is the other half of the cache's question: the cache
//! records what the automatic ladder answered, an [`Override`] records what
//! the user said instead, and a latch always wins.
//!
//! The user types a real series/title name (plus an optional year), picks a
//! candidate and a [`Scope`]. From then on that identity beats the ladder for
//! that one movie file ([`Scope::Movie`]), for the episodes of one season
//! ([`Scope::Season`]), or for every episode under a show folder
//! ([`Scope::Series`]), including episodes indexed later. A latch also carries
//! the cover its scope renders ([`Override::poster`]) and, for a season or a
//! show, the per-episode identities the cards render ([`EpisodePin`]); a movie
//! keeps its picked record ([`Override::media`]) instead. Callers [`load`]
//! once, [`Store::put`] on the user's action, and ask [`Store::resolve_for`]
//! (or the narrower lookups) before consulting the ladder; `None` means "no
//! latch, resolve normally".
//!
//! # Precedence
//!
//! For one file, an exact-file movie latch beats everything; a season latch
//! beats a show latch for that season only; a show latch covers every season
//! without a latch of its own. Pinning the show later never replaces an
//! explicit season latch, and [`Store::season_exceptions`] lists the seasons
//! that carve exceptions out of a show latch.
//!
//! # Keying
//!
//! A `Scope::Movie` key is the media file's FULL path. A `Scope::Season` key
//! is the folder that directly holds the episode ([`season_key_for`]): the
//! `Season N` / `SNN` folder itself when the layout has one, otherwise the
//! release-style folder that IS that season (`...\Atri S01 1080p BDRip`). A
//! `Scope::Series` key is the SHOW FOLDER's full path: the folder the episodes
//! live in, one level above a `Season N` folder when present
//! ([`series_key_for`] derives that key from a file path), and
//! [`Store::lookup_series`] walks a path's ancestors so every episode of the
//! show hits, present or future.
//!
//! The asymmetry is deliberate: a season pin keys the SEASON folder and a show
//! pin keys the SHOW folder ([`series_key_for`] steps over an immediate season
//! folder, [`season_key_for`] never does), so the two latches can coexist on
//! one tree and precedence decides the winner. In a release-style tree the
//! folder can be both the show and its single season, so both functions derive
//! the same key there; the scopes still keep the two latches apart. Keys
//! compare case-insensitively with `\` and `/` normalised to one separator
//! ([`normalize_key`]), so a rescan cannot orphan a latch: a separator or case
//! difference still matches, and an episode re-indexed under
//! `...\Show\Season 2\...` still hits a latch on `...\Show`.
//!
//! # Store file
//!
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Potflix\overrides.json` ([`default_path`]) -- the same
//! convention as `app_support::config::config_path`, restated here because
//! `metadata` has no edge to `app-support`. The shape is
//! `{"version":2,"entries":[...]}` and [`Store::save`] always writes version
//! 2. A stored `version: 1` is still READ and honoured: a v1 entry carries no
//! `poster` and no `episodes` (serde defaults them empty), so an existing
//! store survives the schema change and upgrades on its first save. An absent
//! file is an empty store, and an unknown JSON field is ignored, so a future
//! writer can add fields without breaking this reader. A malformed file is
//! REPORTED, not fatal: [`load`] returns `Err`, never panics, and never
//! rewrites the file; the caller carries on with [`Store::empty`], and only
//! the next successful [`Store::save`] replaces the bad file. A file whose
//! `version` is neither [`STORE_VERSION`] nor 1 is refused the same way:
//! well-formed, but not ours to interpret.
//!
//! # Atomic saves
//!
//! [`Store::save`] follows the repo's existing atomic-write convention
//! (`app_support::config::save_config_to`, the cache's retired per-key
//! writer): marshal, create a uniquely named `.tmp-<pid>-<nanos>-<seq>.json`
//! beside the target, write, close, rename over the target. A failed write or
//! rename removes the temp file and leaves the previous file exactly as it
//! was. [`Store::put`] and [`Store::remove`] save in the same call, and a
//! failed save rolls their in-memory change back, so the store in memory
//! always matches the last successful save.
