/// Proves the keep-alive fix: N sequential `get`+`decode_capped` round trips
/// from one shared client against the same host must reuse ONE TCP
/// connection (baseline: N connections).
///
/// The server pads its JSON with trailing whitespace (valid JSON: the decode
/// succeeds). Padding past the decoder's read buffer is what makes the test
/// discriminate: a tiny body is buffered whole, so even the baseline reuses
/// that connection; with the padding outstanding, the decoder returns while
/// most of the body is still unread, and only the bounded post-decode drain
/// returns the connection to the pool.
///
/// Padding is 256 KiB here where Go uses 64 KiB: the transport (ureq) reads
/// through a 128 KiB input buffer, so the pad must clear that buffer plus the
/// decoder's own read-ahead for the assertion to discriminate at all. The
/// drain cap (512 KiB) is unchanged, so the whole body is still drained.
