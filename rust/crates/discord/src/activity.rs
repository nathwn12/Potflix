//! `discord::activity` -- mirrors `go\internal\discord\activity.go`.
//!
//! The `SET_ACTIVITY` payload shape and its serialization.
//!
//! SET_ACTIVITY carries:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"cmd":"SET_ACTIVITY",
//!  "args":{"pid":<std::process::id()>,
//!          "activity":{"type":3,"name":...,"details":...,"state":...,
//!                      "timestamps":{"start":...,"end":...},
//!                      "assets":{"large_image":"logo","large_text":"PotFlix"}}},
//!  "nonce":"<unique>"}
//! ```
//!
//! `name` overrides the header line ("Watching <title>"); when absent the header
//! falls back to the app name. The body is two lines: details (episode name,
//! else episode tag, else title) and state (episode tag, else empty).
//!
//! A clear is the same command with `"activity":null`. The activity type is
//! Watching (3), not the Java reference's Playing (0): Discord documents the
//! activity time bar as requiring Listening (2) or Watching (3), and "Watching
//! <title>" fits a video player. Deliberate, user-visible deviation -- do not
//! "fix" it. While playing the payload carries BOTH timestamps.start and (when
//! the duration is known) timestamps.end, so the client renders the time bar
//! against the real media position. While paused it carries timestamps.start
//! only, anchored at the pause moment, so the client counts the pause UP
//! ("paused for M:SS"). The pristine card carries NO small_image/small_text (no
//! play/pause/stop corner icon) and NO buttons: the caller-side fields are
//! accepted for compatibility but never serialized. Deliberately NOT set:
//! party, secrets, instance, application_id/name.
//!
//! Empty-string fields are OMITTED, not sent as "". Discord rejects an activity
//! whose assets carry a present-but-empty large_text/small_text (code 4000:
//! "large_text is not allowed to be empty"). The Java app looked like it set
//! empty strings, but the GameSDK's wire serialization dropped empty fields, so
//! parity is "empty text omitted on the wire" -- hence `skip_serializing_if`.
//!
//! One divergence from Go is deliberate and documented: `encoding/json`
//! HTML-escapes `<`, `>` and `&` inside strings (`\u003c`...), `serde_json`
//! leaves them literal. Key order, key set, omission and every value are
//! identical, and Discord parses both encodings to the same activity.
