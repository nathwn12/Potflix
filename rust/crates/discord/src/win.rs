//! `discord::win` -- the Win32 named-pipe primitives under `pipe.go`.
//!
//! `pipe.go` leans on Go's runtime poller: `os.NewFile` on a
//! `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` handle registers it with the poller, so concurrent
//! `Read` and `Write` are safe and `SetWriteDeadline` can cancel a stuck write.
//! Rust has no such poller, so this module does explicitly what the Go runtime
//! does implicitly:
//!
//! * every client handle is opened with `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`;
//! * every read and write is issued as an overlapped operation carrying its own
//!   `OVERLAPPED` plus event, and the result is collected by waiting on that
//!   event -- so a pending read never blocks a write on the same handle;
//! * a write deadline is a `WaitForSingleObject` timeout: on expiry the
//!   operation is cancelled (`CancelIoEx`), drained, and reported as
//!   `ErrorKind::TimedOut` (`os.ErrDeadlineExceeded` in Go);
//! * `close` cancels any pending operation before `CloseHandle`, so a blocked
//!   read pump unblocks exactly as `os.File.Close` does for Go.
//!
//! The fake server's handle stays synchronous (`fakepipe.go`): a blocking
//! `CreateNamedPipeW` handle takes no `OVERLAPPED` at all.
