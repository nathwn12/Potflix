//! `discord::fakepipe` -- mirrors `go\internal\discord\fakepipe.go`.
//!
//! An in-process named-pipe server that speaks the Discord IPC framing. It
//! exists so the package tests and `--selftest` can prove the transport end to
//! end without a running Discord (and without ever touching the real
//! `\\.\pipe\discord-ipc-*` namespace: every instance lives under a
//! process-unique `\\.\pipe\potflix-fake-*` name).
//!
//! The server handle is deliberately *not* overlapped: it is created by
//! `CreateNamedPipeW` and used with plain synchronous reads and writes, exactly
//! as `os.NewFile` on a Go blocking handle behaves.
