//! `discord` -- mirrors the Go package `go\internal\discord`.
//!
//! Local Discord IPC pipe transport over `\\.\pipe\discord-ipc-0..9`:
//! handshake, `SET_ACTIVITY`, `READY` gating, reply matching.
//!
//! This file is the module body for `go\internal\discord\pipe.go`: a named-pipe
//! client for `\\.\pipe\discord-ipc-0..9`. Frame = int32 LE opcode + int32 LE
//! length + JSON payload. Opcodes: 0 handshake, 1 frame, 2 close, 3 ping,
//! 4 pong. The client sends the handshake, a read-pump thread answers PING with
//! PONG and surfaces READY/dispatch frames, and any transport error triggers a
//! reconnect after `Config::retry_delay` (5000 ms default), with the contract's
//! `session dropped: <err>` line emitted through `Config::on_drop`. The delay is
//! damped: the first retry after a drop waits exactly `retry_delay`, and every
//! consecutive unhealthy session -- never READY, or dropped within `READY_GRACE`
//! of READY -- doubles the wait up to `BACKOFF_MAX` (60 s). A session that
//! survives the grace resets the backoff, so a single transient drop still
//! recovers at the plain `retry_delay`; a peer that accepts and never acks
//! settles at the cap instead of reconnecting on every `retry_delay`.
//!
//! Discord answers every command with the SAME nonce. `send` records each
//! outstanding nonce in a nonce-keyed set and the read pump matches an incoming
//! frame against it; a matched frame is surfaced through `Config::on_reply` (an
//! `evt:"ERROR"` rejection carries Discord's own `data.code` and `data.message`).
//! Commands are held back until Discord's READY dispatch (`Error::NotReady`
//! before it), because Discord discards commands sent earlier; READY also fires
//! `Config::on_connect` and bumps the generation. Every write is bounded by a
//! deadline, because the write mutex is held across it: a peer that accepted the
//! connection but stopped draining would otherwise stall the poll loop forever.
//! Nothing on this path is swallowed: the caller logs every reply, every send
//! error, a `push ack timeout` when a command gets no reply, and a write expiry.
//! An unanswered command is unproven, so its timeout drops the connection too:
//! the supervisor reconnects with a fresh handshake and the caller re-delivers,
//! instead of leaving the session limping on a connection that never answered.
//!
//! The Win32 plumbing -- the `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` contract, one event per
//! operation, deadline cancellation -- lives in `win.rs`.
