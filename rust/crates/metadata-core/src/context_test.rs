/// A `Season <N>` FOLDER whose number exceeds `i32::MAX` keeps the whole
/// number, exactly as Go does.
///
/// Go's season-folder pattern is `^Season\s*(\d+)$` -- the digit run is
/// UNBOUNDED (`go\internal\metadata\context.go:21`) -- and `ContextFromPath`
/// reads it with `atoi` (`go\internal\metadata\context.go:127`), which is
/// `strconv.Atoi` (`go\internal\metadata\parse.go:200`) onto a 64-bit `int`.
/// `Query.Season` is likewise `int` (`go\internal\metadata\types.go:27`), so the
/// value survives to `ResolveQuery`'s query -- and `Absolute` stays false
/// because the season is non-zero (`go\internal\metadata\context.go:227`).
///
/// Verified against the frozen reference: a `go test` harness over an untouched
/// copy of `go\` prints `ContextFromPath("2SERIES\Show\Season 2147483648\
/// 01.mkv") = ("Show", 2147483648)` and `ResolveQuery(01.mkv, ...) = kind=1
/// title="Show" season=2147483648 episode=1 absolute=false` (the drive-less
/// spelling exercises the same pass: neither tree needs a volume component).
///
/// The port parsed that capture into `i32`, so `parse()` failed and the number
/// collapsed to 0 -- which ALSO flipped `Absolute` to true. Values above
/// `i64::MAX` clamp the way Go's dropped `ErrRange` clamps
/// (`strconv.ParseInt` returns `MaxInt64`).
